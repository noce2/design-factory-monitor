# Design-Factory-Monitor
This repository contains a system that would allow its users to analyse the
quality, cost and delivery metrics of a "design factory".

## User Stories (Top-level Requirements)
1. As a General User I can see all the designs progressing through my design factory and their position along the "design production line".
2. As a General User I can see, for each design on my production line, the number of times it has to be modified before it passes a review.
3. As a General User I can see for each design, the % quality at its current stage in the design production line.
4. As a General User I can see the amount of hours spent on a design between each review. 
5. As a General User I can see what processes my design has passed through to get to its current state.
6. As a General User I can filter all the design data based on its owning organisation, stage in the process, % quality, hours spent between reviews, or number of times it has failed a review.
7. As a Designer I can be made responsible for a design.
8. As a Designer I can assign a particular review to an approver within my organisation.
9. As a Designer I can submit the necessary documentation which will be used to decide whether my design passes or fails a review.

11. As an Auditor I can attach documentation explaining my rationale for the outcome of the review.
12. As a General User I can see the metrics of the design factory.
13. As an Administrator I can configure the representation of the design production line to match a sequential representation of my organisation's actual process.
